/**
 * `StorageAdapter` — the bring-your-own-persistence interface that
 * decouples the core package from any specific database.
 *
 * Two storage concerns must be solved before any Phase 2 invoice can
 * be issued:
 *
 * 1. **Counter sequence**: every EGS keeps a strictly monotonic
 *    invoice counter (ICV). `incrementCounter` returns the next
 *    sequence + the printable serial.
 * 2. **Hash chain**: every invoice's signed XML embeds the SHA-256
 *    hash of the previous invoice's XML. `getPreviousHash` returns
 *    that value for the next document; the issuer writes the new
 *    hash back via `recordInvoice`.
 *
 * The contract is intentionally narrow. Reference implementations in
 * `packages/storage-{memory,mongo,postgres}` ship in Phase 5.
